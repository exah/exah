## Work

I started working in the web around 11 years ago as a designer + developer when I went to [university](https://design.hse.ru). For the past 5 years, I've been a web software engineer.


### Lead Web Software Engineer @ [Revolut](https://revolut.com/) <br /> November 2018 - Now

I joined Revolut Moscow office in November 2018 as a Senior Web Software Engineer inside [Revolut Business](https://business.revolut.com) team. Alongside the acquiring solution, I developed a shared component library used by more than 10 projects inside the company because I had had prior experience of working on a similar project before.

I moved to the Revolut London office in December 2019 while working on the first public beta release of our acquiring product. In July 2020 I got promoted to Lead Web Software Engineer and right now creating a new team for building a web design system.

### Web Developer @ [Strelka&nbsp;Institute](http://strelka.com) <br /> December 2015 - November 2018

I started working in a small team of 3 people (designer, developer, and project manager) as a second developer. At first, I helped with current projects. Next, we developed a site for partnering educational programs with the Higher School of Economics ([advancedurbandesign.com](http://advancedurbandesign.com)) and a special project based on research done by Strelka students about malls in Seoul ([the-m-all.com](http://the-m-all.com)). These were my first serious end-to-end projects in the trade.

Since the middle of 2016 worked as a lead web developer and the biggest projects for me were the next version of strelka.com (never released) and [strelkamag.com](https://strelkamag.com). For both, I developed a WYSIWYG editor and shared component/design system library.
