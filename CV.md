## Summary 

Web Software Engineer with ~12 years of experience. I began my journey in design, transitioned into web development, and eventually took on leadership roles, guiding teams. I'm proficient in creating design systems, love working on libraries, tools, and enhancing user experience. I've participated in a wide range of projects, from design-focused non-profits to fintech startups.

### Web Software Engineer @ [Apron Payments](https://getapron.com) <br /> September 2022 - Now

I joined Apron Payments, a recently created startup with a small team of ~15 people, during its seed round of investment.

### Lead Web Software Engineer @ [Revolut](https://revolut.com/) <br /> November 2018 - August 2022

I joined Revolut in November 2018 as a Senior Web Software Engineer on the [Revolut Business](https://business.revolut.com) team. During the first years, I participated in creating the acquiring product and in a spare time worked on a shared component library that was used by more than 10 projects in the company.

These efforts led to my promotion to a lead role in July 2020, where I was responsible for creating and managing a new web design system team within the company. As a result, I oversaw a significant redesign and unification of all our web products. We built and maintained the components, guidelines, and tools for other web engineers.

### Web Developer @ [Strelka&nbsp;Institute](http://strelka.com) <br /> December 2015 - November 2018

> The institute ceased to exist after the start of the war in Ukraine. The links in the text below may not work anymore.

I started working in a small team of 3 people (designer, developer, and project manager) as a second developer. Initially, I assisted with ongoing projects. Next, we developed a site for partnering educational programs with the Higher School of Economics ([advancedurbandesign.com](http://advancedurbandesign.com)) and a special project for Strelka students based on their research about malls in Seoul ([the-m-all.com](https://karalevich.com/cases/disrupt-the-m-all)). These were my first serious end-to-end projects in the trade.

Since the middle of 2016, I have worked as a lead web developer. The most significant projects for me were the next version of strelka.com and [strelkamag.com](https://strelkamag.com). For both, I developed a WYSIWYG editor and shared component/design system library.
